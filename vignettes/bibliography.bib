	abstract = {1 Advances in dynamic ecosystem modelling have made a number of different approaches to vegetation dynamics possible. Here we compare two models representing contrasting degrees of abstraction of the processes governing dynamics in real vegetation.2 Model (a) ({GUESS}) simulates explicitly growth and competition among individual plants. Differences in crown structure (height, depth, area and {LAI}) influence relative light uptake by neighbours. Assimilated carbon is allocated individually by each plant to its leaf, fine root and sapwood tissues. Carbon allocation and turnover of sapwood to heartwood in turn govern height and diameter growth.3 Model (b) ({LPJ}) incorporates a ‘dynamic global vegetation model’ ({DGVM}) architecture, simulating growth of populations of plant functional types ({PFTs}) over a grid cell, integrating individual-level processes over the proportional area (foliar projective cover, {FPC}) occupied by each {PFT}. Individual plants are not simulated, but are replaced by explicit parameterizations of their growth and interactions.4 The models are identical in their representation of core physiological and biogeochemical processes. Both also use the same set of {PFTs}, corresponding to the major woody plant groups in Europe, plus a grass type.5 When applied at a range of locations, broadly spanning climatic variation within Europe, both models successfully predicted {PFT} composition and succession within modern natural vegetation. However, the individual-based model performed better in areas where deciduous and evergreen types coincide, and in areas subject to pronounced seasonal water deficits, which would tend to favour grasses over drought-intolerant trees.6 Differences in model performance could be traced to their treatment of individual-level processes, in particular light competition and stress-induced mortality.7 Our results suggest that an explicit individual-based approach to vegetation dynamics may be an advantage in modelling of ecosystem structure and function at the resolution required for regional- to continental-scale studies.},

	abstract = {The {LPJ}-{GUESS} dynamic vegetation model uniquely combines an individual- and patch-based representation of vegetation dynamics with ecosystem biogeochemical cycling from regional to global scales. We present an updated version that includes plant and soil N dynamics, analysing the implications of accounting for C–N interactions on predictions and performance of the model. Stand structural dynamics and allometric scaling of tree growth suggested by global databases of forest stand structure and development were well reproduced by the model in comparison to an earlier multi-model study. Accounting for N cycle dynamics improved the goodness of fit for broadleaved forests. N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates reduces productivity of cold-climate and dry-climate ecosystems relative to mesic temperate and tropical ecosystems. In a model experiment emulating free-air {CO}2 enrichment ({FACE}) treatment for forests globally, N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates of colder soils reduces {CO}2 enhancement of net primary production ({NPP}) for boreal forests, while some temperate and tropical forests exhibit increased {NPP} enhancement. Under a business-as-usual future climate and emissions scenario, ecosystem C storage globally was projected to increase by ca. 10\%; additional N requirements to match this increasing ecosystem C were within the high N supply limit estimated on stoichiometric grounds in an earlier study. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for C–N interactions in studies of global terrestrial N cycling, and as a basis for understanding mechanisms on local scales and in different regional contexts.},

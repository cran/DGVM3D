This is a visualization tool for vegetation structure/succession
in space and/or time mainly for forest gap models. However, it could also be used to
visualize observed forest stands. If used for models, they should contain either
individual trees or cohorts (e.g. LPJ-GUESS by Smith et al. (2014) doi:10.5194/bg-11-2027-2014).
For a list of required and additional data fileds see the vignette.
